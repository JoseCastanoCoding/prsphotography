                sub-licensees and successors in title. ln cases where the Photographers client is a direct client (i.e. with no agency or intermediary), 
                all references in this agreement to both 'the Agency' and 'the Advertiser' shall be interpreted as references to the
                Photographers client. 'Photographs' means all photographic material furnished by the photographer, whether transparencies, negatives, 
                prints or any other type of physical or electronic material.
            </p>
            <li class="list-group-item text-uppercase">copyright</li>
            <p>The entire copyright in the Photographs is retained by the Photographer at all times throughout the world.</p>

            <p>The Licence to Use comes into effect from the date of the relevant invoice(s). No use may be made of the Photographs before payment in full of 
                the relevant invoice(s) without the Photographers express permission. Any permission which may be given for prior use will automatically be revoked 
                if full payment is not made by the due date or if the Agency is put into receivership or liquidation.

                to any third party without the Photographers permission. Accordingly, even where any form of 'all media' Licence is granted, the photographers permission 
                must be obtained before any use of the Photographs for other purposes e.g. use in relation to another product or Sublicensing through a photo library. 
                Permission to use the Photographs for purposes outside the terms of the Licence will normally be granted upon payment of a further fee, which must be 
                mutually agreed (and paid in full) before such further use. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all further Licences in respect of the Photographs will be

                advertising or otherwise promoting his work. After the exclusivity period indicated in the Licence to Use, the Photographer shall be entitled to 
                use the Photographs for any purposes.

            <li class="list-group-item text-uppercase">client confidentiality</li>

                shall only be responsible for obtaining such clearances if this has been expressly agreed before the shoot. In all other cases the Agency shall be responsible for obtaining 
                such clearances and will indemnify the Photographer against all expenses, damages, claims and legal costs arising out of any failure to obtain such clearances.
